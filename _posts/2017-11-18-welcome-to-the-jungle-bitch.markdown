Our second week has brought with it some of the reality of the scope of our project. Heading into the week, we were unsure of our tech stack with most of us only having dabbled a little bit in JavaScript. After some research and discussion, we've agreed that we would build our application with Node.js, using Electron for client interface. We're as excited as we are green, and have started diving deep into courses on these new technologies as we postpone coding to try to devise a design plan.

On the technical side, Janea and Nastya were able to upload Google Assistant on our freshly received Raspberry Pi 3, and Janea further was able to install a motion detector and microphone for discourse.
